# EDA-NYC-Taxi
The project is about Exploratory Data Analysis of real-world scenario. In this case the project consists of detailed EDA of NYC taxi data for year 2023
Required files have been uploaded in zip format. It contains 2 file namely (1. EDA_Assg_NYC_Taxi_Starter_AmitBothe.ipynb 2. Report_NYC_Taxi_Operations_Starter_AmitBothe.pdf)
Jupyter notebook contains the detailed analysis of NYC taxi data and pdf contains the report of the analysis
No data is uploaded due to its size. However it can be sourced from https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page under 2023 year 'Yellow Taxi Trip Records'
### Note Student Comment - 
All my comments are in the code itself. I have tried to explain the code as much as possible. All my analytical observations are stated after the '###' symbol and the code is explained with normal '#' comments.
I have stored and created new data frames based on various important data milestones to reduce the requirement to run the entire file eveytime I load it. This is to reduce the time taken to run the code.
### Assumptions - 
I have assumed that the data is clean and contains data as per year and month.
I have also assumed that the data is not corrupted and is in the correct format.
The sample() function is used to get a random sample of the data as given in isnstructions below. However, I have used the same sample function to the required 300000 rows
as the data is huge and it is not possible to analyze the entire data at once. I have used the same sample function to get the required 300000 rows for analysis.
